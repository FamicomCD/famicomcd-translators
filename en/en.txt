Nintendo had released Super Mario Bros. 2 (known as <q>The Lost Levels</q> in the west) and published many popular action games the previous year.<br><br>Concurrently, the Super Famicom was in development and announced that year by the President of Nintendo. However, Nintendo wished to still support the original, now aging Famicom. This would become the FamicomCD, a CD-ROM based add-on that would be able to utilize CDs to load video games, presented as a cheaper entry point for existing Famicom users into the <q>next generation</q>. This would be a very ambitious endeavor, so to sell the system, it was requested that a technologically improved Super Mario Bros. must be able to be played on this device.<br><br>However, as Hiroshi Yamauchi said in September 1987, <q>Super Mario Bros. 4</q> and many other titles were already in the planning stages for the next version of the Famicom, which left <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Research_%26_Development_1">Nintendo Research & Development Group #1</a> to be the ones to develop the Super Mario Bros. game for FamicomCD rather than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Research_%26_Development_4">Research Group #4</a> (who had worked on a lot of the previous entries and eventually "Super Mario World"), with assistance from Team Shikamaru for much of the planning and some parts of development. The game would look familiar to Super Mario Bros. players, but feature vibrant, colorful, and stunning visuals that weren't possible on the original Famicom, and sounds that were unlike anything from before.<br><br>It was initially planned to make the music of the game match the sound aesthetic of the Famicom games but with higher fidelity instruments, however the new CD spec meant that music was no longer limited by the sound polyphony and synthesis abilities of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricoh_2A03">Famicom's 2A03 chip</a>. There were virtually no limitations in place, sounds could be as rich and full as they could ever sound. This led the production of the music for Super Mario Bros. CD to spin off into being a much more ambitious project, with more musicians and instrumentalists involved to truly make the music take advantage of the new technology."

It is said that the guardian keeps the entire archipelago at peace; poor weather, harvests, or illness is attributed to the guardian being upset. The islands which are affected must make offerings to the guardian to regain her favor.<br><br>Nowadays, the Archipelago of Brixurei is a hot tourist spot, especially during the summer months where a tropical vacation is necessary. Although officially endorsed tourism only came about 25-30 years ago when an archipelago-wide democratic government was instated, the economy of the archipelago now hinges heavily on tourism, largely in part due to merchandise sales and trading. Tourists are rarely allowed onto any island other than the Central Isle as other island’s climates are deemed too harsh for tourism to safely occur.<br><br>With this newfound tourism wealth in recent years, many Brixurians had begun constructing and living in sparse towns. The destructive nature of urban construction caused the government to pass laws banning further expansion of any kind of urban architecture. Only two major towns exist within the whole archipelago, both located in the East Central Isle. The move to sparse towns left many villages, temples, and the belief in the Guardian of Brixurei dwindling at a worrying speed."

strid "deprecated_smbcd_tagline1"
string "Super Mario Bros. CD (SMBCD) is a rom hack of Super Mario World that is a "what if" of sorts for a SMB game on a CD based console! The CD based console in this situation is the FamicomCD, which is a fictional add-on for the Famicom/NES and is not the Super NES CD, which some people seem to mix up."

strid "deprecated_smbcd_tagline2"
string "SMBCD utilizes the MSU-1 chip to deliver original and rich CD-quality music, fully animated cutscenes, and more complex environments, even on original hardware via the SD2SNES/FXPak Pro! SMBCD also heavily utilizes Mode 0 (a SNES background mode, akin to Mode 7) for its levels, providing more layers for foreground environments and background parallax. Mode 0 allows for 4 layers at once rather than the usual 2-3 layers found in SMW by using Mode 1, but it will cause all layers to be 2BPP or 4 colors per tile (this does not include sprite layers and they retain usage of 16 colors)."

strid "deprecated_smbcd_story1"
string "SMBCD takes place upon the small yet diverse Archipelago of Brixurei. One day, mysteriously, The Guardian of Brixurei — the primary source of protection and security for the archipelago — had gone mad, resulting in adverse weather and upset wildlife to run rampant. Locals were left baffled and worried. Those who left their towns to find out what was going on were never heard from since.<br><br>Amidst the chaos caused by the Guardian's sudden outburst, the locals called upon the one and only Mario Bros. to help them. As the Mushroom Kingdom wished farewells, Mario set off by boat towards the Archipelago of Brixurei, bringing Luigi along for the ride. In this journey, the brothers will also meet a new friendly face who will accompany them."

string "FamicomCD is the name of a fictitious Famicom add-on/all-in-one console, the add-on portion akin to the Famicom Disk System. The FamicomCD project was created by King Mayro in Feburary 2023. It was originally created to share mockups of games and software that could've have been on the FamicomCD console/add-on, and soon Super Mario Bros. CD was adapted for the concept as the original SMBCD project had come far before the creation of FamicomCD."

strid "deprecated_about_ar1"
string "In terms of alternate reality, FamicomCD is an add-on for the Famicom, as well as an all-in-one console that released in 1989/1990. There were rumors before this of a floppy disk based add-on called the Famicom Disk System, but nothing came of it and it was soon replaced by the concept of the FamicomCD."

Despite the new controller, the FamicomCD supports original Famicom controllers, and games can choose to limit which controller can be used.<br><br>• Color upload where the system can upload colors directly to the palette or upload colors directly to a pixel on the screen. These colors are 15bit RGB values instead of the Famicom's specific colors, but colors are uploaded each frame so more CPU time is used)."

strid "deprecated_about_riskdesc"
string "With any unlicensed IP use, there's always a risk of anything happening but considering the precedent of stuff like our project Super Mario Bros. CD being a Super Mario World romhack, an avenue of romhacking that's been around for decades now with very little to no interference of Nintendo, we'd imagine we are just as safe as other SMW hacks have been for years.<br><br>We are not intending to infringe copyright or facilitate piracy with the SMBCD project, nor do we intend on making profit from our projects in any way.<br><br><br>Ultimately, there is no hard yes or no on this matter as Nintendo legally can do whatever they want to a project like this, but we don't really have any reason to think they will for the reasons above."
