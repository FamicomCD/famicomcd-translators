Those who left their towns to find out what was going on were never heard from since.<br><br>Amidst the chaos caused by the Guardian's sudden outburst, the locals called upon the one and only Mario Bros. to help them.

strid "deprecated_about_famicomcddesc"
string "FamicomCD is the name of a fictitious Famicom add-on/all-in-one console, the add-on portion akin to the Famicom Disk System. The FamicomCD project was created by King Mayro in Feburary 2023. It was originally created to share mockups of games and software that could've have been on the FamicomCD console/add-on, and soon Super Mario Bros. CD was adapted for the concept as the original SMBCD project had come far before the creation of FamicomCD."

strid "deprecated_about_ar1"
string "In terms of alternate reality, FamicomCD is an add-on for the Famicom, as well as an all-in-one console that released in 1989/1990. There were rumors before this of a floppy disk based add-on called the Famicom Disk System, but nothing came of it and it was soon replaced by the concept of the FamicomCD."

Despite the new controller, the FamicomCD supports original Famicom controllers, and games can choose to limit which controller can be used.<br><br>• Color upload where the system can upload colors directly to the palette or upload colors directly to a pixel on the screen. These colors are 15bit RGB values instead of the Famicom's specific colors, but colors are uploaded each frame so more CPU time is used)."

strid "deprecated_about_riskdesc"
string "With any unlicensed IP use, there's always a risk of anything happening but considering the precedent of stuff like our project Super Mario Bros. CD being a Super Mario World romhack, an avenue of romhacking that's been around for decades now with very little to no interference of Nintendo, we'd imagine we are just as safe as other SMW hacks have been for years.<br><br>We are not intending to infringe copyright or facilitate piracy with the SMBCD project, nor do we intend on making profit from our projects in any way.<br><br><br>Ultimately, there is no hard yes or no on this matter as Nintendo legally can do whatever they want to a project like this, but we don't really have any reason to think they will for the reasons above."
