# Pull Requests and Issues

If you notice any minor translation issues, such as small typos, this does not require a pull request. Simply make a post in the [issues tab](https://github.com/FamicomCD/famicomcd-translators/issues) and we'll have it fixed!

If you're submitting a new language via a pull request, please ensure it's complete or nearly complete, based on the state of the website when you make your translations. We'll take some time to review your translations, and if all is well they should appear on the site.
